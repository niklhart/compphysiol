The Computational Physiology Toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox for computations with 
physiology-based models, in particular physiologically-based pharmacokinetics (PBPK). 
It features a modular object-oriented design, has fully integrated unit 
computation capabilities and an intuitive scripting language.

## Getting started with the Computational Physiology Toolbox

* download file `compphysiol.mlxtb` from the latest release;
* double-click on the file from within MATLAB to install the toolbox;

To render the toolbox documentation searchable, call function 
`compphysiol_builddocsearchdb()` once after installation.
 
* You can then simply type `doc Computational Physiology Toolbox` 
to access the documentation.
